About me :
I'm a french student in electric and electronic embedded systems. The purpose of this application, for me, is to extend my skills in addition of my work at school. Moreover I'm usually programming microcontroller devices, so, to program on a computer is little bit different. Anyways, any contribution or help, improvements, advices ... Will be very appreciate =) .
